## 🎯 **Featured Project: Navigate Vocational Student Well-being**  
In this project, I built a machine learning pipeline to classify vocational college students' mental health status, utilizing demographic, behavioral data, and self-reflection. This project was guided by the AI4ALL Ignite program's instructors and mentors. I applied natural language processing (NLP), supervised learning models, and explainable AI techniques to help with the early intervention of mental health issues.

The project aimed to address the under-researched area of mental health in vocational students, who face unique challenges. By combining structured data (e.g., GPA, sleep hours) and unstructured text data (e.g., self-reflections), the project aimed to develop a scalable early-warning system for mental health concerns.

🔑 **Key Highlights:**  
- Created a labeled dataset with both structured features (e.g., GPA, sleep hours) and emotion vectors extracted from self-reported reflections.  
- Evaluated several supervised learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression) for multi-class classification of mental health status.  
- Achieved a 68% accuracy score with the best-performing model.  
- Conducted feature importance analysis, revealing the most influential factors, such as GPA, emotions (anticipation, sadness), and behavioral factors (sleeping hours, steps per day).

📊 **Methodologies:**  
- Used NLP techniques (NRCLex) to extract emotions from free-text reflections.  
- Normalized features using StandardScaler and encoded categorical data with LabelEncoder.  
- Applied multiple classification models, with hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation, selecting the best-performing model based on F1-score and AUC.  
- Interpreted feature importance using SHAP for transparency and ethical accountability.

🛠️ **Technologies Used:**  
- **Programming language:** Python  
- **Data Processing:** pandas, numpy, LabelEncoder, StandardScaler, joblib  
- **Machine Learning Models:** scikit-learn, XGBoost  
- **NLP & Emotion Detection:** NLTK, NRCLex  
- **Visualization & Interpretation:** matplotlib, seaborn, SHAP

## 🎯 Featured Project: [Sentiment Analysis of Book Reviews]

Check out my Break Through Tech portfolio project on this sentiment classification project! I developed a machine learning model to analyze and classify book reviews as positive or negative, using natural language processing techniques and supervised learning. The pipeline includes data cleaning, TF-IDF vectorization, model benchmarking, and hyperparameter tuning, achieving over 80% accuracy and balanced F1-scores.
