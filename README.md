## 🎯 **Neuroscience-Driven Learning Engagement System**  
In this project, our team developed a prototype predictive system to identify learner disengagement risk by combining EEG brain-wave features with self-reported survey data. The system links cognitive load and attention signals to engagement outcomes using dimensionality reduction and lightweight, interpretable machine learning models, enabling early detection and adaptive learning interventions.

The project addresses a key gap in professional and technical training environments: disengagement is often detected too late, after performance or completion metrics decline. By integrating neuroscience-informed signals with traditional survey inputs, this system aims to capture engagement in real time and support proactive, personalized learning strategies at scale.

🔑 **Key Highlights:**  
- Built an end-to-end machine learning pipeline combining EEG-derived features and learner survey signals  
- Achieved strong predictive performance (≈ 80%+ accuracy on held-out data) while maintaining model interpretability  
- Identified early warning indicators of disengagement that precede self-reported difficulty or fatigue  
- Designed with fairness, transparency, and enterprise training constraints in mind  

📊 **Methodologies:**  
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) on multimodal data (EEG features + surveys)  
- Applied preprocessing techniques including normalization, categorical encoding, and feature alignment  
- Tested multiple interpretable models (Logistic Regression, Random Forests, Decision Trees)  
- Performed feature selection, cross-validation, and hyperparameter tuning  
- Evaluated performance using Accuracy and F1-score, with additional fairness checks across subgroups  

🛠️ **Technologies Used:**  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Data Processing:** pandas, numpy  
- **Machine Learning:** scikit-learn  
- **Dimensionality Reduction & Feature Engineering:** PCA, statistical feature selection  
- **Visualization & Dashboard:** matplotlib, seaborn, Streamlit

## 🎯 **Navigate Vocational Student Well-being**  
In this project, I built a machine learning pipeline to classify vocational college students' mental health status, utilizing demographic, behavioral data, and self-reflection. This project was guided by the AI4ALL Ignite program's instructors and mentors. I applied natural language processing (NLP), supervised learning models, and explainable AI techniques to help with the early intervention of mental health issues.

The project aimed to address the under-researched area of mental health in vocational students, who face unique challenges. By combining structured data (e.g., GPA, sleep hours) and unstructured text data (e.g., self-reflections), the project aimed to develop a scalable early-warning system for mental health concerns.

🔑 **Key Highlights:**  
- Created a labeled dataset with both structured features (e.g., GPA, sleep hours) and emotion vectors extracted from self-reported reflections.  
- Evaluated several supervised learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression) for multi-class classification of mental health status.  
- Achieved a 68% accuracy score with the best-performing model.  
- Conducted feature importance analysis, revealing the most influential factors, such as GPA, emotions (anticipation, sadness), and behavioral factors (sleeping hours, steps per day).

📊 **Methodologies:**  
- Used NLP techniques (NRCLex) to extract emotions from free-text reflections.  
- Normalized features using StandardScaler and encoded categorical data with LabelEncoder.  
- Applied multiple classification models, with hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation, selecting the best-performing model based on F1-score and AUC.  
- Interpreted feature importance using SHAP for transparency and ethical accountability.

🛠️ **Technologies Used:**  
- **Programming language:** Python  
- **Data Processing:** pandas, numpy, LabelEncoder, StandardScaler, joblib  
- **Machine Learning Models:** scikit-learn, XGBoost  
- **NLP & Emotion Detection:** NLTK, NRCLex  
- **Visualization & Interpretation:** matplotlib, seaborn, SHAP

## 🎯 Sentiment Analysis of Book Reviews

Check out my Break Through Tech portfolio project on this sentiment classification project! I developed a machine learning model to analyze and classify book reviews as positive or negative, using natural language processing techniques and supervised learning. The pipeline includes data cleaning, TF-IDF vectorization, model benchmarking, and hyperparameter tuning, achieving over 80% accuracy and balanced F1-scores.
