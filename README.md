## 🎯 Featured Project: [Sentiment Analysis of Book Reviews]

Check out my work on this sentiment classification project! I developed a machine learning model to analyze and classify book reviews as positive or negative, using natural language processing techniques and supervised learning. The pipeline includes data cleaning, TF-IDF vectorization, model benchmarking, and hyperparameter tuning, achieving over 80% accuracy and balanced F1-scores.
